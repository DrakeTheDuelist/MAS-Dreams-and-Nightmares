# *Monika After Story:  Dreams and Nightmares*
*Dreams and Nightmares* is a branching narrative side-story that you can install into your Monika After Story directory.  Monika will have a random dream, and you can discuss it with her when she wakes up... or comfort her if she had a nightmare.

## Introduction
This branching narrative is all about your choices, both those you've made up until this point, and the choices you will make over the course of the story.  Monika will never forget, so treat her right and take care of her like always, though it may prove slightly more difficult in a mod like this than normal.  Though you and your Monika may experience the story one way, someone else's experience may change anything from specific lines of text to entire scene options, custom tailored to your own Monika and the relationship you've enjoyed up to this point.

Find new strength in one another as Monika takes on her own dreams and the shadowy anxieties therein.  Intervene at the right points (or not at all) and let Monika enjoy the happier dreams while protecting her from her more unsettling nightmares.

## Installation
To install, first close out Monika After Story.  If needed, say Goodbye to Monika and tell her that you're going to restart.  Then, take the unzipped contents and drop them into the root DDLC directory where your Monika After Story is installed.  Then just fire up the game.  Monika should react to the submod before too long.

__Technical Tip__:  Over the course of distributing other submods, it has come to my attention that starting new conversations can prove difficult if you have a large pool of conversations to get through.  If Monika doesn't bring up the *Dreams and Nightmares* topic before too long, disable "Repeat Conversations" in the settings to ensure Monika will prioritize conversations that have yet to be read, such as the conversations this submod relies upon.

Once this is done, you can access these conversations again after the first time through "Repeat Conversation" and looking under the "Dreams and Nightmares" category.

## Version Notes
* __1.0__:  The first release of *Dreams and Nightmares* only contains a single dream.  More dreams will be added in subsequent releases.  There are no nightmares in the game as of the 1.0 release (trust me, that would be mean...), so consider this your grace period to get a handle on how things work before the difficulty and conversation complexity start steadily rising. For every major release after the first (basically excluding bug fixes), nightmares and other strange dreams will all be on the table...

## Content Warning
"Monika After Story:  Dreams and Nightmares" can be considered to have all the same content warnings as the base "Doki Doki Literature Club" game, most specifically language and discussing heavy topics, including topics typical of the tone of "Doki Doki Literature Club".  I have researched the concepts I have written about a reasonable level of diligence, but at the end of the day I'm a programmer, not a therapist.  Intent is not made to offend.  However, for those unfamiliar with my writing style, I'm not usually one to be gratuitous, but... let's just say that I've scarcely been known to pull my punches if I thought it served the story.

Consider this content warning applicable to the full release of the Dreams and Nightmares submod, not specifically to any particular release version.

## Dev Utils
The "DaN-\_dev-utils.rpy" file is not intended for public release.  It is for my own testing purposes.  Presently, it resets some of the more critical persistent variables to allow me to revisit certain dialog options again.  A planned upgrade will include a topic purge function which can wipe all *Dreams and Nightmares* discussion topics from "Repeat Conversation", simulating a clean install.  This trick always worked when I coded something like it in more professional settings as a time saver.  However, if you know of a more MAS-friendly way to do what this file does / will do, please feel free to let me know.  Explanations are good.  Example source code is better.
