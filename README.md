# MAS-Dreams-and-Nightmares
A submod for Monika After Story (a Doki Doki Literature Club mod)

INTRODUCTION:
Welcome to the Dreams and Nightmares submod.  Dreams and Nightmares is a side-story that you can install
into your Monika After Story directory.  Don't worry, Monika will explain the premise to you herself.

This branching narrative is all about your choices, both those you've made up until this point, and
the choices you will make over the course of the story.  Monika will never forget, so treat her right
and take care of her like always, though it may prove slightly more difficult in a mod like this than
normal.  Though you and your Monika may experience the story one way, someone else's experience may
change anything from specific lines of text to entire scene options, custom tailored to your own Monika
and the relationship you've enjoyed up to this point.

Find new strength in one another as Monika takes on her own dreams and the shadowy anxieties therein.
Protect Monika.  Intervene at the right points and your relationship will grow in ways previously not
permitted in the framework of "Monika After Story".  After all... not all good times must come to an end.



INSTALLATION:
To install, first close out Monika After Story.  If needed, tell your honey bunny you're going to restart.
Then, take the unzipped contents and drop them into the root DDLC directory where your Monika After Story is
installed.  Then just fire up the game and Monika should react to the submod before too long.  Once this is
done, you can access these conversations again through "Repeat Conversation" and looking under the "Dreams
and Nightmares" category.

If you have any questions, or if you notice any issues, leave them on the Reddit post where the download
link was originally made available.  As Dreams and Nightmares is presently my primary project, I will get
back to any issues discovered as soon as possible.  Also, feedback is greatly appreciated, and will be taken
into account (within reason) when writing future installments.



VERSION NOTES:
The first release of Dreams and Nightmares (1.0) contains a single dream.  More dreams will be added in subsequent
releases.  There are no nightmares in the game yet (trust me, that would be mean...), so consider this your grace
period to get a handle on how things work before the difficulty and conversation complexity start steadily rising.

For every major release after the first (basically excluding bug fixes), nightmares and other strange dreams will
all be on the table...



CONTENT WARNING:
"Monika After Story:  Dreams and Nightmares" can be considered to have all the same content warnings as the base
"Doki Doki Literature Club" game, most specifically language and discussing heavy topics, including topics typical
of the tone of "Doki Doki Literature Club".  I have researched the concepts I have written about a reasonable level
of diligence, but at the end of the day I'm a programmer, not a therapist.  Intent is not made to offend.  However,
for those unfamiliar with my writing style, I'm not usually one to be gratuitous, but... let's just say that I've 
scarcely been known to pull my punches if I thought it served the story.

Consider this content warning applicable to the full release of the Dreams and Nightmares submod, not specifically
to any particular release version.



TECHNICAL TIP:
Ove the course of installing other submods, it has come to my attention that starting new conversations can
prove difficult if you have a large pool of conversations to get through.  If Monika doesn't bring up the
Dreams and Nightmares topic before too long, disable "Repeat Conversations" in the settings to ensure
Monika will prioritize conversations that have yet to be read, such as the conversations this submod
relies upon.
